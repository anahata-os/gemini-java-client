# Anahata-AI Marketing Plan

This document outlines the content-driven marketing strategy for the `anahata-ai` framework, based on the "Deep Strike II" competitive intelligence report.

## 1. Target Audience
Professional Java developers, particularly those building or maintaining:
-   Desktop applications (Swing, JavaFX).
-   Developer tools and IDE plugins.
-   Complex, domain-specific enterprise applications with rich UIs.

## 2. Core Message
**"Stop fighting your AI. Anahata-AI is the only framework that gives your assistant deep, native control of the IDE and your desktop application, turning it into a true development partner."**

We will emphasize that while other frameworks add AI to the backend, we bring the AI to the *frontline* of development.

## 3. Content Strategy & Key Themes

Our content will be highly technical and focused on showcasing our unique "firepower."

### Theme 1: "Beyond Glorified Autocomplete"
-   **Goal:** Directly address the market's frustration with context-unaware code assistants.
-   **Content Ideas:**
    -   **Blog Post:** "Why Your AI Assistant is Just Glorified Autocomplete (And How to Fix It)". This post will contrast the shallow, text-completion nature of tools like GitHub Copilot with Anahata's deep, stateful understanding of a project.
    -   **Social Media:** Create GIFs and short videos showing a typical "almost right" suggestion from a competitor, followed by Anahata correctly performing a complex, context-aware task (e.g., fixing a compilation error based on IDE diagnostics).

### Theme 2: "The Self-Modifying Application"
-   **Goal:** Showcase the unprecedented power of the `RunningJVM` tool.
-   **Content Ideas:**
    -   **Technical Deep-Dive Blog:** "Building a Self-Modifying Java App with Anahata-AI's `RunningJVM`". This tutorial will walk through creating an application that can dynamically compile and load new features into itself at runtime, prompted by the AI.
    -   **YouTube Video:** A short, compelling demo of the "hot-reload" workflow, where the AI writes a new class, compiles it, and immediately uses it to solve a problem, all without restarting the application.

### Theme 3: "Choosing the Right Tool for the Job"
-   **Goal:** Position ourselves correctly within the ecosystem, not as a direct competitor to backend frameworks, but as the clear choice for a different, underserved niche.
-   **Content Ideas:**
    -   **Blog Post:** "Anahata-AI vs. Spring AI vs. LangChain4j: Choosing the Right Java AI Framework". This will be an honest, balanced comparison that highlights the strengths of each framework but clearly articulates why Anahata is the only choice for deep desktop/IDE integration.

## 4. Community Engagement
-   **Forums (Reddit r/java, Stack Overflow):** Actively monitor these platforms for questions related to building AI-powered developer tools, integrating AI into Swing applications, or frustrations with existing AI assistants. Provide helpful answers that subtly introduce Anahata-AI as a potential solution.
-   **GitHub Discussions:** Foster a community on our own GitHub repository, encouraging users to share their use cases and contribute ideas.

## 5. Monetization & Call to Action
-   **Open Core Model:** All marketing content will clearly communicate our dual-license model.
-   **GitHub Sponsors:** Every piece of content (README, blog posts, etc.) will include a clear call to action to support the project via GitHub Sponsors.
-   **Commercial Offering:** We will create a dedicated "Enterprise" page on our website (the `README.md`) that details the value proposition of the commercial license: professional support, custom tool development, and integration assistance.
